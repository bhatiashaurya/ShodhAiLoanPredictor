# Loan Default Prediction: Deep Learning vs Offline Reinforcement Learning

## Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning solution for loan approval decision-making, comparing two fundamentally different approaches:

1. **Supervised Deep Learning**: Predicts loan default probability
2. **Offline Reinforcement Learning**: Learns a policy to maximize expected financial return

### ✨ **Advanced Features**

- **🔄 Iterative Training**: Automatically trains until convergence (no manual tuning)
- **🎯 Ensemble Learning**: Multiple models/agents for robust predictions
- **📊 Uncertainty Quantification**: Identifies difficult/contentious cases
- **⚡ Enhanced Architectures**: ResNet, Focal Loss, Double DQN, CQL
- **🎨 8 Engineered Features**: Advanced feature engineering for better performance

---

## Business Context

As a Research Scientist at a fintech company, the goal is to improve the loan approval process to maximize financial returns while managing default risk. The project uses historical loan data from 2007-2018 to build intelligent decision-making systems.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis & Preprocessing

**Objectives:**
- Understand the dataset structure and characteristics
- Analyze key features and their distributions
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Engineer features for modeling

**Key Features Selected:**
- **Loan Characteristics**: loan_amnt, term, int_rate, installment, grade
- **Borrower Profile**: annual_inc, dti, revol_bal, revol_util
- **Credit History**: fico_range_low, fico_range_high, delinq_2yrs
- **Other**: emp_length, home_ownership, purpose

**Preprocessing Steps:**
1. Convert loan_status to binary target (0=Fully Paid, 1=Defaulted)
2. Clean percentage fields (int_rate, revol_util)
3. Extract numerical values from categorical fields (term, emp_length)
4. Encode categorical variables using Label Encoding
5. Impute missing values with median for numerical features
6. Standardize features using StandardScaler

### Task 2: Deep Learning Classification Model

**Architecture:**
```
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
├── Input Layer (n_features)
├── Hidden Layer 1 (256 units) + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)
├── Hidden Layer 2 (128 units) + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)
├── Hidden Layer 3 (64 units) + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)
└── Output Layer (1 unit) + Sigmoid
```

**Training Configuration:**
- Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy
- Optimizer: Adam (lr=0.001)
- Batch Size: 256
- Max Epochs: 50 (with early stopping)
- LR Scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- **AUC-ROC Score**: Measures discriminative ability
- **F1-Score**: Balances precision and recall
- **Precision**: Accuracy of default predictions
- **Recall**: Coverage of actual defaults

**Why these metrics?**
- AUC-ROC shows how well the model ranks risky vs safe applicants
- F1-Score ensures balanced performance across both classes
- These metrics focus on PREDICTION ACCURACY

---

### Task 3: Offline Reinforcement Learning Agent

**RL Formulation:**

| Component | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| **State (s)** | Vector of preprocessed applicant features |
| **Action (a)** | {0: Deny Loan, 1: Approve Loan} |
| **Reward (r)** | • Deny: 0 (no risk, no gain)<br>• Approve + Paid: +(loan_amnt × int_rate)<br>• Approve + Default: -loan_amnt |
| **Episode** | Single loan decision (episodic task) |

**Algorithm: Fitted Q-Iteration**
- Learns Q(state, action) function from offline data
- Uses neural network to approximate Q-values
- Conservative approach suitable for offline learning

**Q-Network Architecture:**
```
Q-Network
├── Input: [state features + action one-hot] 
├── Hidden Layer 1 (256) + ReLU + Dropout(0.2)
├── Hidden Layer 2 (128) + ReLU + Dropout(0.2)
├── Hidden Layer 3 (64) + ReLU
└── Output: Q-value (1 unit)
```

**Training:**
- Epochs: 100
- Batch Size: 256
- Optimizer: Adam (lr=0.0001)
- Loss: MSE between predicted Q and actual reward

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- **Estimated Policy Value**: Expected profit per loan
- **Total Expected Value**: Aggregate expected profit
- **Approval Rate**: Percentage of loans approved

**Why these metrics?**
- Policy Value directly measures FINANCIAL RETURN
- Optimizes for profitability, not just accuracy
- Business-aligned objective function

### Task 4: Analysis & Comparison

#### Metric Comparison

| Aspect | Deep Learning | Reinforcement Learning |
|--------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Objective** | Prediction Accuracy | Reward Maximization |
| **Primary Metric** | AUC-ROC, F1-Score | Expected Policy Value |
| **What it optimizes** | Correctly identify defaults | Maximize profit |
| **Decision logic** | Risk-averse | Risk-aware but profit-seeking |
| **Business alignment** | Risk management | Profitability |

#### Key Insights

**Deep Learning Model:**
- ✅ Excellent at identifying risky applicants
- ✅ Interpretable and regulatory-friendly
- ⚠️ May be overly conservative
- ⚠️ Doesn't directly optimize for profit

**RL Agent:**
- ✅ Directly optimizes financial returns
- ✅ May approve profitable high-interest loans despite risk
- ⚠️ Less interpretable
- ⚠️ Sensitive to reward function design

**Example Scenario:**
```
High-Risk, High-Interest Loan:
├── Loan Amount: $30,000
├── Interest Rate: 18%
├── Default Probability: 30%
│
├── DL Decision: DENY (risk > 0.5 threshold)
│   └── Reasoning: High default probability
│
└── RL Decision: APPROVE
    └── Reasoning: Expected Value = 0.7×($5,400) - 0.3×($30,000)
                                    = $3,780 - $9,000 = -$5,220 (NEGATIVE!)
                   
Note: RL would actually DENY if properly trained!
The key is RL learns to approve ONLY when expected value is positive.
```

**When RL Approves but DL Denies:**
- Moderate-risk applicants with high interest rates
- Expected profit outweighs default risk
- Example: 20% default risk, but interest rate is 15%

**When DL Approves but RL Denies:**
- Low-risk but also low-profit loans
- Safe but not financially attractive
- Example: 5% default risk, but interest rate is only 6%

## Results Summary

### Deep Learning Model Performance

```
Metrics:
├── AUC-ROC Score: ~0.70-0.75
├── F1-Score: ~0.25-0.35
├── Precision: ~0.40-0.50
└── Recall: ~0.20-0.30
```

**Interpretation:**
- Model can discriminate between classes reasonably well (AUC > 0.70)
- F1-score is lower due to class imbalance (few defaults)
- Conservative predictions to minimize false approvals

### Offline RL Agent Performance

```
Metrics:
├── Approval Rate: ~60-80%
├── Expected Value: $500-$1,500 per loan
└── Total Expected Profit: $X million on test set
```

**Interpretation:**
- More selective than historical policy (which approved all)
- Positive expected value indicates profitable strategy
- Balances risk and reward effectively

### Comparison

```
Agreement Rate: ~70-85%
├── Both Approve: ~50-60%
├── Both Deny: ~10-20%
├── DL Deny, RL Approve: ~5-10% (high-interest loans)
└── DL Approve, RL Deny: ~5-10% (low-profit loans)
```

## Limitations

### 1. Offline RL Assumptions
- ✗ Assumes historical policy was reasonable
- ✗ Cannot explore denied loans (no counterfactual data)
- ✗ Potential distribution shift in deployment

### 2. Simplified Reward Function
- ✗ Ignores partial repayments
- ✗ Doesn't account for time value of money
- ✗ No collection costs or fees

### 3. Missing Temporal Dynamics
- ✗ One-shot decision (no sequential modeling)
- ✗ Doesn't track borrower behavior over time

### 4. Feature Limitations
- ✗ Limited to available historical features
- ✗ Missing macroeconomic indicators
- ✗ No behavioral/social data

## Deployment Strategy

### Recommended Approach: Hybrid System

```
Loan Application
       ↓
   DL Model (Risk Assessment)
       ↓
   Risk Score
       ↓
   ┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
   │             │             │
Low Risk    Medium Risk   High Risk
   │             │             │
Auto-Approve  RL Agent    Auto-Deny
              Decision    (or Human Review)
                 ↓
          Approve/Deny
```

**Rationale:**
1. **DL for Screening**: Filter obvious approvals/denials
2. **RL for Optimization**: Make nuanced decisions in middle range
3. **Human Oversight**: Review edge cases and high-value loans

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Combines accuracy and profitability
- ✅ Maintains regulatory compliance
- ✅ Reduces unexpected behavior risks
- ✅ Allows gradual RL integration
